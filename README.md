## [bookinfo](https://istio.io/docs/examples/bookinfo/)

The Bookinfo application is broken into four separate microservices:

productpage. The productpage microservice calls the details and reviews microservices to populate the page.
details. The details microservice contains book information.
reviews. The reviews microservice contains book reviews. It also calls the ratings microservice.
ratings. The ratings microservice contains book ranking information that accompanies a book review.
There are 3 versions of the reviews microservice:

Version v1 doesnâ€™t call the ratings service.
Version v2 calls the ratings service, and displays each rating as 1 to 5 black stars.
Version v3 calls the ratings service, and displays each rating as 1 to 5 red stars.

- Install Workloads

  ```
  $ kubectl apply -f ./bookinfo/bookinfo.yaml
  $ kubectl apply -f ./bookinfo/networking/bookinfo-vs.yaml
  ```
  
  NOTE: Before you can use Istio to control the Bookinfo version routing, you need to define the available versions, called subsets, in destination rules.
  
- Define Destination Rules

  ```
  $ kubectl apply -f ./bookinfo/networking/destination-rule-all.yaml
  $ kubectl get destinationrules -o yaml
  ```
